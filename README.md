# Docker-based MCP Servers

This directory contains Docker-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for use with Claude Code.

## Structure

- `Dockerfile.base` - Base Docker image for MCP servers
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration for all servers
- `scripts/` - Wrapper scripts for each MCP server
- `.env.template` - Template for environment variables
- `manage.sh` - Management script for easy control
- `test-servers.sh` - Test script to verify servers

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   # or
   ./manage.sh build
   ```
